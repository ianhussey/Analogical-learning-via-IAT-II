# The IAT as an analogical learning task II

## Description & purpose

Explores whether the IAT functions as an analogical learning task when known stimuli (images of black and white individuals) are employed. That is, whether the IAT trains what it seeks to test.

Measures, processing scripts, and analysis scripts for an experiment on the IAT as an analogical learning task. Project on Open Science Framework with the design, data, and analysis can be found here http://osf.io/7pbjq

- Measures written in Inquisit (v4.0).
- Processing scripts and analyses scripts written in R (v3.3) with additional packages.
